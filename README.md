# Epistatic-effect-detection-and-GS-model-integration
Epistatic effects refer to non-additive interactions between loci controlling the same trait. Genomic selection (GS) accelerates plant breeding by predicting phenotypic effects in individuals based on genomic marker profiles. However, current mainstream GS models primarily construct prediction equations based on additive genetic effects, failing to fully leverage non-additive effects such as epistasis to enhance prediction accuracy. This study identified significant dominant interaction SNP pairs through pathway-level dominance testing, incorporated them into the GS model, and evaluated the enhancement of genomic prediction accuracy by epistatic effects.
